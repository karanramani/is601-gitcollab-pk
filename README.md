# Git Tutorial

### Benefits of using Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration:
 
* Git repository is a version-control system that is used to keep track of the collaborative work amongst the various number of team members within the source code. It is a system that one can use to track the changes for coordinating work and track changes in any set of files that an individual person and/or organization has attended to within the repository.
* Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host.
* Automated testing is used to keep the software being tested separated from the original software itself. It is used to predict the outcomes before fully implying the updates to the software.
* Continuous integration is a practice of merging all of the developerâ€™s working copies to a shared location several times in a day.

##### In order for a company to continuously improve their productivity in a competitive market their teams are required to collaborate and keep the source updates. Also, sharing the confidential files in a large scale environment securely is also mandatory. That is where the services like GIT and Docker come in for the security and ease of the development updates continuously being updated in the source code. Along with that features like automated testing within these products saves a lot of time and efforts by individuals to make new updates stand out and test them before making any fixed change to the original code.
